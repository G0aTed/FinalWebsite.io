            In telecommunication and data transmission, serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over a communication channel or computer bus. 
            <br><br>
            Serial communication is used for all long-haul communication and most computer networks, where the cost of cable and synchronization difficulties make parallel communication impractical. Serial computer buses are becoming more common even at shorter distances, as improved signal integrity and transmission speeds in newer serial technologies have begun to outweigh the parallel bus's advantage of simplicity.
            <br><br>
            Compared to parallel communication, serial communications are slower, but are also far more concistent in the data they transfer and have a far lower chance of said data being corrupted or in the incorrect order.

            Parallel communication is a method of conveying multiple binary digits simultaneously, which is achieved by having multiple channels for data to travel through, a common number of which is 8 channels, allowing for an entire byte to be transferred in the time it takes serial transmission to transfer one bit.
            <br><br>
            Parallel communication is and always has been widely used within integrated circuits, in peripheral buses, and in memory devices such as RAM. Computer system buses, on the other hand, have evolved over time: parallel communication was commonly used in earlier system buses, whereas serial communications are prevalent in modern computers.    
            <br><br>
            Compared to serial communication, parallel communications are faster and more predominantly used to transfer data between shorter physical spaces, as its multiple channels significantly increase the amount of data corruption or loss.

        <h2>Simplex, Half-duplex and Duplex Communication</h2>
    </section>
    <section class="paragraph">
        <p1 align="left">
            Simplex communication is a communication channel that sends information in one direction only. An example of this is a radio or TV broadcast that can only be recieved and not responded to.
            <br><br>
            A half-duplex system provides communication in both directions, but only one direction at a time, not simultaneously in both directions. An example of this is a pair of Walkie-Talkies, which can communicate to each other but only one at a time.
            <br><br>
            A duplex communication system is a point-to-point system composed of two or more connected parties or devices that can communicate with one another in both directions. An example of this is a phone call, where both parties can talk to each other at the same time.

            A packet is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks, such as the Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them.
            <br><br>
            A packet it concisted of two parts, control information, as well as its paylaod. The control information includes the source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, or sequencing information, whilst the payload carries the small segment of data that the packet carries.
            <br><br>
            It is constructed from a header, which includes the destination address of the packet, the payload, which stores the data, and the trailer, which stores the rest of the control information.
