            Sir Timothy Berners Lee, born on June 8, 1955, is a computer scientist best known for inventing the internet. He is also a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Professorial Fellow of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Queen Elizabeth II knighted Berners-Lee in 2004 for his pioneering work in technology.

            He created and implemented the first Web browser and Web server, and he was instrumental in the Web's subsequent explosive growth. He currently leads the W3 Consortium, which creates tools and standards to help the Web reach its full potential. He was elected as a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences in April 2009.

            He was named one of Time magazine's "100 Most Important People of the 20th Century" and has received numerous other honors for his invention. During the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was honored as the "Inventor of the World Wide Web," appearing with a vintage NeXT Computer. He tweeted "This is for everyone," which was displayed in LED lights attached to the audience chairs. He was awarded the Turing Prize in 2016 "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms that allow the Web to scale."

            From June to December 1980, Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext to help researchers share and update information. He created a prototype system called ENQUIRE to demonstrate it.
            <br><br>
            CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe in 1989, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to connect hypertext to the Internet:

            <br><br>
            "I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide Web."
            <br><br>
            — Tim Berners-Lee
            <br><br>
            "Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the Internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system."
            <br><br>
            — Tim Berners-Lee
            <br><br>
            Berners-Lee published the first web site, which described the project itself, on 20 December 1990; it was available to the Internet from the CERN network. The site provided an explanation of what the World Wide Web was, and how people could use a browser and set up a web server, as well as how to get started with your own website. On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee first posted, on Usenet, a public invitation for collaboration with the WorldWideWeb project.

            Berners-Lee established one of the most enduring legacies in human history by inventing the most widely used communication system in the modern era.

            On June 13, 2007, he was appointed to the Order of Merit, which has only 24 members. Membership in the Order of Merit is bestowed solely by the Queen and does not require the approval of ministers or the Prime Minister.
            <br><br>
            In 2001, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 2004, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society, and in 2007, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.
            <br><br>
            Berners-Lee was one of the British cultural icons chosen by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version in 2012.
            <br><br>
            In 2013, he was awarded the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. On 4 April 2017, he received the 2016 ACM Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale".
